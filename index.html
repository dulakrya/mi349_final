            <p>
            I have always had a passion towards technology, and an interest in learning anything
            related to technology. This has driven me to be in the field that I am studying, and

            I am currently a senior at Michigan State University studying Information Science. After
            graduating in May of 2022, I hope to continue pursuing a career in whatever
            technological related job I end up in.
